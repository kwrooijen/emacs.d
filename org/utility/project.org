** Custom :custom:

Don't use fd, use git-ls instead

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(projectile-git-use-fd nil)
#+END_SRC

Set indexing method to `hybrid`.
If set to `alien`, indexing won't use `projectile-globally-ignored-file-suffixes`.
If set to `native`, indexing will be very slow

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(projectile-indexing-method 'hybrid)
#+END_SRC

Ignore all images

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq projectile-globally-ignored-file-suffixes
 '(".gif" ".jpeg" ".jpg" ".png" ".svg" "eot" "ttf" "woff" "woff2" "min.js" "min.css"))
#+END_SRC



** Config :config:

There doesn't seem to be an option in projectile to exclude submodules
in `projectile-find-file`. To "fix" this for now, we force
`projectile-get-sub-projects-files` to always return nil.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun projectile-get-sub-projects-files (_ _) nil)
#+END_SRC

Add any `projectile-globally-ignored-file-suffixes` to `grep-find-ignored-files`.
This should work for `consult-ripgrep`.
TODO: Check if this is still necessary
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(dolist (file projectile-globally-ignored-file-suffixes)
  (add-to-list 'grep-find-ignored-files (concat "*" file)))
#+END_SRC
